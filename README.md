# DESIGN PATTERNS For Go

A simple design pattern repository for Go. All of the patterns are taken from the
[Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
book, but are written in somewhat different ways than the implementations provided
in the book. The reason for this is that the implementation of the patterns in the
book are only relavent to C++ and Java, because of the inherent OOP nature of those
languages. In Go, because the OOP works a bit differently, the implementations are
not quite the same. This I made this repo for my own reference for looking up
design patterns in Go.
